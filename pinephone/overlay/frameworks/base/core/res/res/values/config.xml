    <!-- User activity timeout: Minimum screen off timeout in milliseconds.

         Sets a lower bound for the {@link Settings.System#SCREEN_OFF_TIMEOUT} setting
         which determines how soon the device will go to sleep when there is no
         user activity.

         This value must be greater than zero, otherwise the device will immediately
         fall asleep again as soon as it is awoken.

         Sleep is buggy, set to 10 hours on pinephone as a temporary workaround.
